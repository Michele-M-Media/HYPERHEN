 * One that is off, unplugged, on another network, or resting with its network
 * features turned off says nothing at all. The engine asks DDP when the helper
 * cannot be reached and reports the verdict on the status reply as `power`
 * (and, for rest mode, the reason token `console_rest_mode`).
 *
 * `payloadStatus` keeps its meaning ("down" while asleep); this is the extra
 * fact that lets the app say "in rest mode" calmly instead of "helper isn't
