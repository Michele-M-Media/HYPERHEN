/* File transfer pieces for the console page's Files (webui_api.c is the glue): saving a text file
 * atomically, receiving an upload into a file, sending a file (with a Range) or a folder as a .tar,
 * all over the web server's blocking sockets with an idle timeout instead of the 5 s connection
 * deadline. No path policy here: the routes decide what may be read or written, then call these.
 *
 * Every write goes to a temporary name in the TARGET'S OWN FOLDER and is renamed onto the target
 * only after a same-device check: a rename never crosses a mount (on this kernel that panics the
 * console). A failure or a cancel removes the temporary file; the target is never truncated. */
