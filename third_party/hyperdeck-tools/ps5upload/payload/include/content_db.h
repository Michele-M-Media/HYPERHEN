/*
 * The console's content databases, read (and repaired) through a real
 * SQLite that the payload links statically.
 *
 * Background: no PS5 firmware ships libSceSqlite.sprx under any library
 * path, so every dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "sqlite3_open_v2") in this codebase
 * resolved to NULL on every console. Two handlers carried a full SQL
 * implementation behind that probe and neither had ever executed; the
 * hand-rolled b-tree walker in appdb_scan.h was doing all the work.
 *
 * That was the right fix for reading title ids, and it stays as the
 * fallback here. What it cannot do is (a) reassemble a row whose columns
 * are serialized blobs — which is why play-time queries were declared
 * impossible — or (b) write. Repairing a console that lists a title it
 * refuses to delete means writing.
 *
 * "Sony does not ship SQLite" is a fact about the platform, not about
 * what we can link. See payload/Makefile for the build flags.
 *
 * Everything here is bounded and emits JSON into a caller-owned buffer.

 * `total` is the table's row count, sent only from SQL (the scanner's is a
 * lower bound); a caller that sees it change between pages knows rows
 * moved under it.
 * `next` is the row the following page starts at; `more` is true while
 * rows remain after it. A page that fills `buf` before `limit` rows stops
 * early with `more` set, so a small buffer pages rather than silently
 * dropping the rest. `truncated` is true only when rows exist that no
 * page can deliver: one row larger than `buf`, a SQL walk that stopped
 * before the end (SQLITE_BUSY and the like), or the byte scanner (the
 * fallback for a database that will not open) hitting its own bounds.
 *
 * `limit` 0 (or above CONTENT_DB_APPS_PAGE_MAX) means
 * CONTENT_DB_APPS_PAGE_MAX. An older engine sends no window at all and
 * reads page one; the extra fields are ignored by its decoder.
 *
 * `source` is reported rather than hidden: a caller that sees "scan"
 * knows the SQL open failed and the row set came from the byte-level
 * reader, which recovers ids reliably but names only sometimes.
 *
 * Never fails outright — falls back to appdb_scan.h, and an unreadable
 * database is {"err":"..","apps":[]}. Returns 0 on success, non-zero only
 * if `buf` is too small to hold even an error.
