/**
 * "What is PS5Upload" posts for people who have never seen it: the features, the platforms,
 * how to start, and where to download. Not release notes (that's release-posts.js).
 *
 * Usage
 *   make promo-post                         # = node scripts/promo-posts.js
 *   node scripts/promo-posts.js --out DIR   # write elsewhere
 *
 * Writes `.release_posts/about/` (git-ignored), one file per thing you paste, shaped for each
 * platform like release-posts.js does:
 *   x-1-main.txt, x-2-reply.txt, …   plain text, 280 characters each (links count as 23)
 *   discord.md                       Discord markdown, under 2000 characters
 *   reddit-title.txt, reddit-body.md the title box and the Markdown body
 *   images/                          app screenshots to attach (site/assets), as PNG
 *   README.md                        what goes where, with lengths
 *
 * The version and download link come from VERSION; everything else is the text below. Keep it
 * in line with README.md's "What it does" when a big feature lands.
